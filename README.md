## Best Practices

1. **Use Modular Infrastructure**: Leverage reusable Terraform modules for consistent and efficient infrastructure management.

2. **Parameterize Configurations**: Define variables for environment-specific customizations.

3. **Automate with Purpose**: Select the appropriate automation tool (Python or Bash) based on your infrastructure scale and complexity.

4. **Monitor Outputs**: Use Terraform outputs to integrate with observability tools.
